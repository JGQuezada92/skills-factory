## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Analysis Too Generic
**Symptoms:** Output lacks specificity, uses vague language
**Solution:** Provide more specific data points, company details
**Prevention:** Include concrete metrics in initial request

### Issue 2: Missing Sector-Specific Analysis
**Symptoms:** AI company analyzed without AI-specific frameworks
**Solution:** Explicitly request AI/crypto-specific metrics
**Prevention:** Mention sector prominently in request

### Issue 3: Recommendation Unclear
**Symptoms:** Wishy-washy conclusion, no clear Buy/Sell
**Solution:** Request explicit recommendation with conviction level
**Prevention:** Ask for "Strong Buy/Buy/Hold/Sell/Strong Sell" format

### Issue 4: No Comp Analysis
**Symptoms:** Valuation done in vacuum without peers
**Solution:** Provide peer companies or request comp table
**Prevention:** Mention competitive landscape in initial request

### Issue 5: Risk Analysis Superficial
**Symptoms:** Generic risks, no quantification
**Solution:** Request risk matrix with probability/impact scores
**Prevention:** Ask for "comprehensive risk assessment"
