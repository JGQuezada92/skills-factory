# Claude Skills Generator System

A comprehensive system for generating custom Claude Skills based on your business requirements. This toolkit provides everything you need to create professional, production-ready skills that extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools.

## 🎯 What This System Does

This system helps you:
1. **Define** your business requirements and use cases in a structured configuration file
2. **Generate** a comprehensive prompt that Claude uses to create custom skills
3. **Package** skills with all necessary components (SKILL.md, scripts, testing materials)
4. **Test** skills with realistic sample data and comprehensive test scenarios
5. **Deploy** skills across Claude apps, API, and Claude Code

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyYAML library (`pip install pyyaml`)
- A Claude account (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise for Claude apps)
- Basic understanding of your business workflows and use cases

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

### Step 2: Configure Your Requirements

Open `skills_config.yaml` and fill in your information:

```yaml
business:
  description: "Your business description here..."
  industry: "Your industry"
  team_size: "10-50"
  primary_workflows:
    - "Data Analysis"
    - "Client Reporting"

skills:
  count: 3
  overlap_strategy: "overlapping"  # or "mutually_exclusive"
  use_cases:
    - name: "Financial Analysis"
      description: "Detailed description of what this skill should do..."
      requires_python: true
      sample_data_type: "excel"
```

**Important:** Replace all placeholder text (anything in square brackets `[...]`) with your actual information.

### Step 3: Generate Your Skills Prompt

Run the generator script:

```bash
python generate_skills.py
```

This creates a file at `generated_skills/SKILLS_GENERATION_PROMPT.md` containing a complete, customized prompt for Claude.

### Step 4: Use the Prompt with Claude

1. Open the generated prompt file: `generated_skills/SKILLS_GENERATION_PROMPT.md`
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Start a new conversation with Claude
4. Paste the prompt
5. Claude will generate your custom skills with all components

### Step 5: Test Your Skills

For each generated skill:

1. Review the `TESTING_GUIDE/` folder
2. Use the sample data provided in `sample_data/`
3. Try the invocation prompts from `invocation_prompts.txt`
4. Follow the test scenarios in `test_scenarios.md`

### Step 6: Package Skills

Package each generated skill into a ZIP file:

```bash
# Package a single skill
python package_skill.py ./generated_skills/my-skill --output "../my-skill.zip"

# Or use the automation script to package all skills
build_and_package.bat  # Windows
```

This creates `.zip` files ready for import.

### Step 7: Import Skills into Claude

**For Claude Apps (Web/Mobile):**
1. Go to Settings → Features → Skills
2. Click "Import Skill"
3. Upload the `.zip` file generated for each skill

**For Claude Code:**
1. Copy skill folders to `~/.claude/skills/`
2. Claude Code will auto-detect and load them

**For API:**
1. Use the `/v1/skills` endpoint to upload skills programmatically
2. Reference skills in your API requests

### Step 8: Iterate and Improve

After testing your skill, make improvements:

```bash
# 1. Edit the source files
notepad ./generated_skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# 2. Re-package
python package_skill.py ./generated_skills/my-skill --output "../my-skill.zip"

# 3. Re-import to Claude (delete old, import new)
```

**Remember:** Always edit files in the `generated_skills/` folder, never the ZIP directly!

## 📝 Configuration Guide

### Business Section

```yaml
business:
  description: |
    Detailed description of your business, products, services, and market.
    Be specific - this helps Claude understand your context.
    
  industry: "e.g., Financial Services, Healthcare, E-commerce"
  
  team_size: "e.g., 10-50"
  
  primary_workflows:
    - "Workflow 1"
    - "Workflow 2"
```

**Tips:**
- Be specific about your business model and goals
- Mention key tools and platforms you use
- Describe your team's typical tasks and challenges

### Skills Section

```yaml
skills:
  count: 3  # How many skills to generate
  
  overlap_strategy: "overlapping"  # or "mutually_exclusive"
  
  use_cases:
    - name: "Descriptive Name"
      description: |
        Detailed explanation of what this skill should accomplish.
        Include specific tasks, expected inputs/outputs, and workflows.
      requires_python: true  # true if needs executable scripts
      sample_data_type: "csv"  # csv, json, excel, pdf, image, text, api, none
```

**Overlap Strategies:**

- **`overlapping`**: Skills can share functionality and work together. Good for creating a skill ecosystem where skills complement each other.
- **`mutually_exclusive`**: Each skill has distinct, non-overlapping purposes. Good for clearly separated domains.

**Sample Data Types:**
- `csv` - For data analysis, reporting, financial data
- `json` - For API data, structured configurations
- `excel` - For spreadsheet-based workflows, financial models
- `pdf` - For document processing, report generation
- `image` - For image processing, visual analysis
- `text` - For text processing, content analysis
- `api` - For API integrations (includes JSON examples)
- `none` - For skills that don't need sample data

### Advanced Section (Optional)

```yaml
advanced:
  integrations:
    - "Excel"
    - "Salesforce"
    - "Your internal API"
  
  domain_knowledge:
    - "Industry-specific terminology"
    - "Compliance requirements"
  
  preferred_languages:
    - "python"
  
  constraints:
    - "Must work offline"
    - "Must comply with HIPAA"
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Custom Output Location

Specify a custom output path:

```bash
python generate_skills.py skills_config.yaml custom_output/prompt.md
```

### Multiple Configuration Files

Create different config files for different projects:

```bash
python generate_skills.py finance_skills_config.yaml
python generate_skills.py marketing_skills_config.yaml
python generate_skills.py operations_skills_config.yaml
```

### Iterating on Skills

#### Understanding the Two-Folder System

**The Source Folder (Workshop):**
```
generated_skills/
└── my-skill/                  ← EDIT FILES HERE
    ├── SKILL.md               ← Modify skill instructions
    ├── scripts/               ← Update Python scripts
    └── TESTING_GUIDE/         ← Update test data
```

**The ZIP File (Distribution):**
```
Claude Skills/
└── my-skill.zip               ← IMPORT TO CLAUDE
```

**Key Concept:** The folder is your **editable source code**. The ZIP is the **packaged product** you import into Claude. Always edit the folder first, then re-package to create a new ZIP.

---

#### Workflow: Making Changes to Existing Skills

After Claude generates skills, you can refine them:

**Option 1: Edit Existing Skill Files Directly**

```bash
# 1. Edit source files in generated_skills/
notepad generated_skills\my-skill\SKILL.md
# Make your changes, save the file

# 2. Re-package the skill
python package_skill.py generated_skills\my-skill --output "C:\path\to\my-skill.zip"

# 3. Re-import to Claude
# Go to Claude.ai → Settings → Skills
# Delete old skill, import new ZIP

# 4. Test the changes
```

**Option 2: Generate New Skills from Updated Config**

```bash
# 1. Update your requirements in skills_config.yaml
# 2. Generate new prompt
python generate_skills.py

# 3. Ask Claude to refine based on feedback
# Paste prompt + "Please improve X based on this feedback: ..."

# 4. Package and import updated skills
```

---

#### Common Editing Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Make Output More Concise**
```bash
# Edit: generated_skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
# Find section describing output format
# Change: "Generate comprehensive 5-page analysis"
# To: "Generate concise 1-2 page summary"
# Re-package and import
```

**Scenario 2: Add New Python Script**
```bash
# Create: generated_skills/my-skill/scripts/new_feature.py
# Update: generated_skills/my-skill/SKILL.md to reference new script
# Re-package and import
```

**Scenario 3: Update Sample Data**
```bash
# Replace: generated_skills/my-skill/TESTING_GUIDE/sample_data/data.csv
# This helps with YOUR testing (not included in ZIP)
# No need to re-package
```

**Scenario 4: Add Reference Documentation**
```bash
# Create: generated_skills/my-skill/references/industry_guide.md
# Update: generated_skills/my-skill/SKILL.md to reference it
# Re-package and import
```

## 🎓 Understanding Skills

### What Makes a Good Skill?

**Good skills:**
- Solve specific, recurring problems
- Provide value beyond general Claude capabilities
- Include clear, actionable instructions
- Have well-defined trigger conditions
- Come with comprehensive testing materials

**Skills work best for:**
- Domain-specific workflows (e.g., SEC filing analysis)
- Company-specific processes (e.g., internal reporting formats)
- Tool integrations (e.g., specialized Excel operations)
- Specialized knowledge (e.g., regulatory compliance)

### When to Use Python Scripts

Include Python scripts in `scripts/` when:
- ✅ Deterministic reliability is required (exact calculations)
- ✅ Code is repeatedly rewritten (same logic every time)
- ✅ Complex operations (PDF manipulation, image processing)
- ✅ Performance matters (large files, complex algorithms)

Don't include Python scripts for:
- ❌ Simple text transformations
- ❌ Basic analysis Claude can do naturally
- ❌ Tasks requiring flexibility and adaptation
- ❌ One-off operations

### Skill Triggering

Claude automatically selects skills based on:
1. **Skill description** - Be specific about when to use the skill
2. **Keywords** - Include relevant keywords at the end of SKILL.md
3. **Context** - The user's request and uploaded files
4. **Chain of thought** - Claude's reasoning about which skills are relevant

**Pro tip:** You can explicitly invoke a skill by saying:
```
Hey Claude—I just added the "skill-name" skill. Can you make something amazing with it?
```

## 🔍 Validation and Quality Assurance

Before importing skills into Claude, validate them to ensure they meet quality standards and Anthropic's specifications.

### Validate a Skill

```bash
python validate_skill.py <skill_folder>
```

The validator performs comprehensive checks:
- ✅ SKILL.md structure and YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Required markdown sections present
- ✅ No second-person pronouns (you/your)
- ✅ No placeholder text remaining
- ✅ Python script syntax (if present)
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- ✅ File naming conventions
- ✅ Content quality standards

### Validation Modes

```bash
# Verbose output (show all issues including INFO)
python validate_skill.py <skill_folder> --verbose
python validate_skill.py <skill_folder> -v

# Strict mode (treat warnings as errors)
python validate_skill.py <skill_folder> --strict

# JSON output (for CI/CD integration)
python validate_skill.py <skill_folder> --json
```

### Understanding Validation Results

**Severity Levels:**
- **ERROR** (❌) - Must be fixed before packaging
- **WARNING** (⚠️) - Should be addressed for quality
- **INFO** (ℹ️) - Suggestions for improvement

**Example Output:**
```
=================================================================== ✓ VALIDATION PASSED
======================================================================

Skill: financial-analysis
Path: ./generated_skills/financial-analysis

Summary:
  Errors:   0
  Warnings: 2
  Info:     1
```

### Fix Common Validation Issues

#### Second-Person Pronouns
```markdown
❌ Wrong: "You should load the file and process your data."
✅ Correct: "Load the file and process the data."
```

#### Placeholder Text
```markdown
❌ Wrong: "[TODO: Add description here]"
✅ Correct: "Process financial data and generate reports."
```

#### Hardcoded Secrets
```python
# ❌ Wrong
API_KEY = "sk_live_1234567890..."

# ✅ Correct
import os
API_KEY = os.getenv('API_KEY')
```

#### Missing Sections
Every SKILL.md should have:
- Main title (H1)
- Overview section
- When to Use section
- How to Use section

---

## 📦 Packaging Skills

After validation, package skills into .zip files ready for Claude import.

### Package a Single Skill

```bash
python package_skill.py <skill_folder>
```

This creates `<skill-name>.zip` in the skill folder, ready to import into Claude.

### Package Options

```bash
# Custom output path
python package_skill.py <skill_folder> --output /path/to/output.zip

# Skip validation (not recommended)
python package_skill.py <skill_folder> --no-validate

# Force packaging despite warnings
python package_skill.py <skill_folder> --force
```

### Batch Packaging

Package all skills in a directory at once:

```bash
python package_skill.py --batch ./generated_skills
```

### What Gets Packaged

**✅ Included:**
- `SKILL.md` (required)
- `scripts/` folder with Python scripts
- `references/` folder with documentation
- `assets/` folder with templates/resources
- `LICENSE.txt` (if present)
- `manifest.json` (auto-generated with checksums)

**❌ Excluded:**
- `TESTING_GUIDE/` folder
- `.zip` files
- Hidden files (`.git`, `.DS_Store`, etc.)
- Python cache (`__pycache__`, `*.pyc`)
- Test files (`test_*.py`, `*_test.py`)
- Backup files (`*.backup`, `*.bak`)

### Package Manifest

Each package includes a `manifest.json` with:
```json
{
  "name": "skill-name",
  "version": "1.0",
  "created": "2025-10-25T12:00:00Z",
  "packager_version": "1.0",
  "description": "Skill description from frontmatter",
  "files": {
    "SKILL.md": {
      "checksum": "sha256_hash",
      "size": 1234
    },
    "scripts": {
      "scripts/process.py": {
        "checksum": "sha256_hash",
        "size": 567
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Complete Workflow (First Time)

```bash
# 1. Generate skills prompt
python generate_skills.py

# 2. Use prompt with Claude to generate skills
# (Claude creates skill folders in generated_skills/)

# 3. Validate generated skill
python validate_skill.py ./generated_skills/my-skill

# 4. Fix any errors found
notepad ./generated_skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
# ... make edits ...

# 5. Re-validate
python validate_skill.py ./generated_skills/my-skill

# 6. Package when validation passes
python package_skill.py ./generated_skills/my-skill --output "../my-skill.zip"

# 7. Import into Claude
# Settings → Features → Skills → Import → Upload my-skill.zip

# 8. Test the skill in Claude
```

---

### Iterative Workflow (Making Changes)

After using the skill and finding improvements needed:

```bash
# 1. Edit source files in generated_skills/
notepad ./generated_skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
# OR
notepad ./generated_skills/my-skill/scripts/analyzer.py

# 2. Test changes locally (optional)
python ./generated_skills/my-skill/scripts/analyzer.py

# 3. Validate changes
python validate_skill.py ./generated_skills/my-skill

# 4. Re-package with updated code
python package_skill.py ./generated_skills/my-skill --output "../my-skill.zip"
# This OVERWRITES the old ZIP with your changes

# 5. Re-import to Claude
# Delete old skill in Claude → Import new ZIP

# 6. Test updated skill
```

**Key Point:** You can repeat steps 1-6 as many times as needed. The source folder in `generated_skills/` is your development environment!

---

## 🗂️ Generation Metadata & Tracking

The system automatically tracks generation history and metadata.

### Generation Log

Every time you generate skills, an entry is added to `generated_skills/generation_log.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-10-25T10:30:00Z",
    "config_version": "1.0",
    "skills_requested": 3,
    "use_cases": ["Financial Analysis", "Report Generator", "Data Validator"],
    "output_path": "./generated_skills/SKILLS_GENERATION_PROMPT.md",
    "status": "generated",
    "business_industry": "Financial Services",
    "overlap_strategy": "overlapping"
  }
]
```

### Metadata in Generated Prompts

Generated prompts include HTML comment metadata:
```html
<!-- GENERATION METADATA

## 📊 Testing Your Skills

### Basic Testing Workflow

1. **Use sample data**: Start with the provided sample data files
2. **Try invocation prompts**: Use the examples in `invocation_prompts.txt`
3. **Follow test scenarios**: Work through basic → intermediate → advanced
4. **Check edge cases**: Test error handling and unusual inputs
5. **Verify quality**: Ensure outputs meet your standards

### Test Scenario Levels

- **Basic**: Core functionality with standard inputs
- **Intermediate**: More complex tasks, multi-step workflows
- **Advanced**: Edge cases, integrations, large-scale data

### Creating Better Test Data

Make sample data realistic:
- Use actual data structures from your business
- Include edge cases and variations
- Represent real-world complexity
- Remove sensitive information
- Document what the data represents

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Skill Doesn't Trigger

**Problem:** Claude doesn't use the skill when expected.

**Solutions:**
- Make the skill description more specific
- Add relevant keywords to SKILL.md
- Explicitly mention the skill in your prompt
- Check if another skill might be conflicting

### Configuration Validation Errors

**Problem:** Script reports missing or invalid configuration.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure all required sections are present
- Remove or replace placeholder text (`[...]`)
- Check YAML syntax (indentation matters!)
- Validate with a YAML linter

### Python Scripts Not Executing

**Problem:** Scripts aren't running or have errors.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure Python is installed and accessible
- Check script has proper error handling
- Verify all dependencies are documented
- Test scripts independently first

### Generated Prompt Is Too Long

**Problem:** Prompt exceeds Claude's context limits.

**Solutions:**
- Reduce the number of skills in one generation
- Simplify use case descriptions
- Remove optional sections not needed
- Generate skills in batches

## 💡 Best Practices

### Configuration
- Be specific and detailed in your descriptions
- Use realistic use cases from actual workflows
- Start with 2-3 skills, add more later
- Test and iterate - skills can be refined

### Skill Design
- Keep SKILL.md under 5,000 words
- Use reference files for detailed documentation
- Include only essential scripts
- Make skills independently useful

### Testing
- Always test with realistic data
- Cover basic, intermediate, and advanced scenarios
- Document issues and iterate
- Create a feedback loop for improvements

### Deployment
- Start with one skill at a time
- Test thoroughly before team-wide deployment
- Document how and when to use each skill
- Gather user feedback and refine

## 🔄 Iteration and Improvement

Skills are meant to evolve:

1. **Deploy** a skill and use it for real work
2. **Observe** where it excels and where it struggles
3. **Document** issues and improvement ideas
4. **Update** the configuration with refined requirements
5. **Regenerate** the prompt and work with Claude to improve
6. **Test** the updated skill
7. **Repeat** the cycle

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How many skills should I create?**
A: Start with 2-3 focused skills. It's better to have a few excellent skills than many mediocre ones.

**Q: Can skills work together?**
A: Yes! Use `overlap_strategy: "overlapping"` to create skills that complement each other.

**Q: Do all skills need Python scripts?**
A: No. Only include scripts when you need deterministic reliability or repeatedly rewrite the same code.

**Q: How long does it take to generate skills?**
A: Claude typically generates a complete skill in 5-15 minutes, depending on complexity.

**Q: Can I modify generated skills?**
A: Absolutely! Skills are meant to be iterated on. Make changes and test improvements.

**Q: What's the difference between the skill folder and the ZIP file?**
A: 
- **Folder** (`generated_skills/my-skill/`) = Your **workshop** where you edit and develop
- **ZIP file** (`my-skill.zip`) = The **final product** you import to Claude
- Always edit files in the folder, then re-package to create a new ZIP
- Think: Source code (folder) → Compiled app (ZIP)

**Q: I want to change something in my skill. Do I edit the ZIP?**
A: No! Never edit the ZIP. Instead:
1. Edit files in `generated_skills/my-skill/` folder
2. Re-run `python package_skill.py generated_skills/my-skill`
3. Re-import the new ZIP to Claude
4. The ZIP is automatically regenerated from your source folder

**Q: Why are there two locations (generated_skills/ and Claude Skills/)?**
A: 
- `generated_skills/` = Development workspace (editable source files)
- `Claude Skills/` (or your chosen output) = Distribution folder (ready-to-import ZIPs)
- This separation keeps your development work organized from your production packages

**Q: What's the difference between references/ and assets/?**
A: References are loaded into context (docs, schemas). Assets are used in outputs (templates, images).

**Q: How do I share skills with my team?**
A: 
- Claude apps: Share the .zip file to import
- Claude Code: Share via version control
- API: Upload via the skills endpoint

**Q: Can I use skills across different Claude products?**
A: Yes! Skills use the same format everywhere and work across Claude apps, Claude Code, and API.
